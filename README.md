# Shapes

![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/obirler/Shapes/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a project that demonstrates the use of different shapes in C#.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (Shapes.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore the necessary packages and compile the project.
4. Build the Shapes.Library project to compile the shape classes.
5. Build the Shapes.VBLibrary project to compile the Visual Basic.Net shape classes.

## Usage

Run the project from Visual Studio. The application will demonstrate the use of different shapes.

## Usage of Shapes.Library

To use the Shapes.Library in your project, add a reference to the Shapes.Library.csproj file in your project file. You can then use the shape classes in your code.

## Usage of Shapes.VBLibrary

To use the Shapes.VBLibrary in your project, add a reference to the Shapes.VBLibrary.vbproj file in your project file. You can then use the Visual Basic.Net shape classes in your code.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
dotnet test Shapes.Tests
```

## C++ CLR Project Setup Instructions

1. Open the solution file (Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj) in Visual Studio.

### C++ CLR Project Build Instructions

1. Open the solution file (Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj) in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to restore the necessary packages and compile the project.
3. Build the Shapes.CLRProject project to compile the shape classes.

### C++ CLR Project Usage

Run the project from Visual Studio. The application will demonstrate the use of different shapes in C++ CLR.

To use the shape classes in your project, add a reference to the Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj file in your project file. You can then use the shape classes in your code. Make sure to also add a reference to the Shapes project in the Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj file.
