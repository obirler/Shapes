# Shapes

![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/obirler/Shapes/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a project that demonstrates the use of different shapes in C#.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (Shapes.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore the necessary packages and compile the project.
4. Build the Shapes.Library project to compile the shape classes.
5. Build the Shapes.VBLibrary project to compile the Visual Basic.Net shape classes.

## Usage

To generate desired shapes using the ShapeFactory class, follow these steps:

1. Run the project from Visual Studio. The application will demonstrate the use of different shapes.

2. To use the Shapes.Library in your project, add a reference to the Shapes.Library.csproj file in your project file. You can then use the shape classes in your code.

3. To use the Shapes.VBLibrary in your project, add a reference to the Shapes.VBLibrary.vbproj file in your project file. You can then use the Visual Basic.Net shape classes in your code.

4. To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
dotnet test Shapes.Tests
```

1. C++ CLR Project Setup Instructions:
   1. C++ CLR Project Setup Instructions:
      - Open the solution file (Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj) in Visual Studio.
   2. C++ CLR Project Build Instructions:
      - Build the solution to restore the necessary packages and compile the project.
      - Build the Shapes.CLRProject project to compile the shape classes.
   3. C++ CLR Project Usage:
2. C++ CLR Project Usage:
   - Run the project from Visual Studio. The application will demonstrate the use of different shapes in C++ CLR.
   - To use the shape classes in your project, add a reference to the Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj file in your project file. You can then use the shape classes in your code. Make sure to also add a reference to the Shapes project in the Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj file.

### C++ CLR Project Usage

Run the project from Visual Studio. The application will demonstrate the use of different shapes in C++ CLR.

To use the shape classes in your project, add a reference to the Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj file in your project file. You can then use the shape classes in your code. Make sure to also add a reference to the Shapes project in the Shapes.CLRProject.vcxproj file.
